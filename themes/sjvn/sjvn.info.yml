# This theme is marked as @internal. It is intended to evolve and change over
# minor releases.
# As the UI of Drupal improves between minor versions, the markup and assets in
# the sjvn theme will change. The sjvn theme is not backwards compatible
# If you wish to modify the output or assets of sjvn you can:
# 1. Copy the whole of sjvn and rename it as your own theme. You will need to
# manually manage your own updates if you want to stay up to date with sjvn's
# bug fixes and feature support.
#
# 2. Sub-theme sjvn. This is only recommended if you want to make minor
# tweaks and understand that sjvn could break your modifications as it
# changes.
